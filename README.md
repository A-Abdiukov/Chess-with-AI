#  Chess with in-built AI
### Based on C# .NET 5.0

Chess game with competent Artificial Intelligence.

This is a side project I have been working on for a ✨while✨. 

The GUI is responsive to different screen sizes because it is programmatic. 

The project is based on the MVC model and does not require an internet connection.
